regarding unit movement:

MP = movement points

diagonal movement costs 1.5 MP, direct movement costs 1.0 MP.

MP that cannot be used in a turn (because of terrain or lacking MP) are transfered into the next turn.

example:
a unit has 2 MP in a turn. a diagonal movement is executed. the unit has 0.5 MP left but cannot use them.
0.5 MP are transferred into the next turn, so the unit starts it with 2.5 MP, making both a diagonal and direct movement possible.
